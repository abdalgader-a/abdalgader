##### Abstract

Recently, pretraining methods for the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful at learning effective representations from unlabeled graph data. However, most of these methods rely on pairwise relations in the graph and do not capture the underling higher-order relations between entities. Hypergraphs are versatile and expressive structures that can effectively model higher-order relationships among entities in the data. Despite the efforts to adapt GNNs to hypergraphs (HyperGNN), there are currently no fully self-supervised pretraining methods for HyperGNN on heterogeneous hypergraphs. In this paper, we present SPHH, a novel self-supervised pretraining framework for heterogeneous HyperGNNs. Our method is able to effectively capture higher-order relations among entities in the data in a self-supervised manner. SPHH is consist of two self-supervised pretraining tasks that aim to simultaneously learn both local and global representations of the entities in the hypergraph by using informative representations derived from the hypergraph structure. Overall, our work presents a significant advancement in the field of self-supervised pretraining of HyperGNNs, and has the potential to improve the performance of various graph-based downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction tasks which are mapped to hypergraph configuration. Our experiments on two real-world benchmarks using four different HyperGNN models show that our proposed SPHH framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that SPHH is able to improve the performance of various HyperGNN models in various downstream tasks, regardless of their architecture or complexity, which highlights the robustness of our framework.
